## Our World.

My project "Our World" hopes to inform the public on the natural world's current 
issues such as climate change and deforesation. I decided to base my project on this 
for a few reasons, one being that I'm passionate about world preservation and helping
people see the good they can do with small changes to the way they lead their lives.

My project aim is to showcase what we are doing to our world. I will achieve this
through videos, pictures and informative text. I also plan on having links to other,
real informative websites. 

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Header - The header contains 4 links. The "Our World" title leads to Google Earth, as a quaint reference to what the website is about. The other links are "Who Are We?", "Make a Difference" and "Donate". 
The header collapses with screen width. 

Callout - The callout contains impact text and a youtube video discussing the amazon rainforest.

Gallery - The gallery has some photos of the environment in peril, coupled with boxes of information. When scaled down, the gallery becomes an image slider - rotating between a few different images. 

Newsletter - The newsletter is a feature that would theoretically allow users to sign up for weekly, informative news. 

Footer - The footer brings social links to the work, as well as a secondary navigation to allow ease of access after reaching the bottom of the page. Including a Contact
tab as well, with a link that directly opens up a draft email to the ficitonal company. These footer features collapses into columns with width changes.

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
